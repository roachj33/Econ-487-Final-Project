# Econ-487-Final-Project
Analysis of online retailer data to determine how to best increase revenue and maximize extraction of value from customers.
The dataset was sourced from [this link](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/online+retail)

In order to run the Rmd file, it is expected that the user has the following packages installed:
* lubridate
* chron
* sf
* ggplot2
* dplyr
* RColorBrewer
* knitr
* maps
* viridis
* rnaturalearth
* rnaturalearthdata
* rgeos
* mapproj
* tidyr
* heatmaply

If any of these packages are not installed on the user's device, the command "install.packages(`package`)"
will address this issue.
